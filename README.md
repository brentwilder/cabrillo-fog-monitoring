# Cabrillo Fog Monitoring Project

### After installing cameras, set up r-hazer package to run on a scheduler. Have python export to a spreadsheet for documenting time series, percentage, and location of fog. Wrap up by conducting spatial analysis of fog data with respect to Planet Labs NDVI.

TO-DO:
- write python scheduler script
- install cameras
- work with AK to conduct RTK/GPS
- think about possible UI / spatial interfacing of fog data
